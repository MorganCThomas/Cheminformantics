# Benchmarking chemical exploration in de novo drug design with MolExp

This contains the data and jupyter notebook to arrive at the analysis in the blog post.

You can create a python environment from the environment file.

```
mamba env create -f environment.yml
```

I have not tested this, additional libraries may need installation, you will find out when running the notebook :D.
